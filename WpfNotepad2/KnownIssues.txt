Highlighting text and moving mouse above or below screen does not scroll window
text going off screen while typing / pasting often will not scroll into view
ctrl + a for large files takes significantly long


// FIXED | editing a theme, not saving, closing theme editor, opening theme editor - reverts changes
Should prompt user for saving theme if theme has been edited and closing the actual application (not theme window it self)
